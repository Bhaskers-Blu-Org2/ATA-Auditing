# WE'VE MOVED
No worries, what you are looking for still exists and is updated/maintained, but it has a new page.

We moved this content to:
https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Advanced-Threat-Protection

Our short-URL has been updated as well, which includes:
https://aka.ms/ataauditing


This shift helps move all our workarounds for Azure ATP and ATA in a single location.

Have questions?  Please contact (Andrew Harris)[mailto:aharri@microsoft.com] or the (Azure ATP Customer Experience Engineering (CxE) team)[mailto:aatpgtp@microsoft.com].
