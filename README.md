# Introduction
Understanding Audit Policy configuration is imperative for your Domain Controllers.  This includes Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA) as well.

# Getting Started
For explicit details on using this script, please refer [here](https://aka.ms/ataauditingblog).

For default values (assess against v1.8, throttling with 10 concurrent processes):
    .\Measure-AtaDeployment.ps1

To configure the throttling of the processes (i.e. not being run on a DC or from a well resourced machine), use the "RunJobsThrottle" parameter.  In this example, we set this paramter to 100:
    .\Measure-AtaDeployment.ps1 -RunJobsThrottle 100

To assess against ATA's v1.7, use the "AtaVersion" Parameter, which takes a *string* value:
    .\Measure-AtaDeployment.ps1 -AtaVersion "1.7"
